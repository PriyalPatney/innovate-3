        "desc" : "Citizenship is not a subject; it is a way of living. Therefore, its learning demands appropriate practice in the living of it. Our approach has to be, not &quot;What does a good citizen know?&quot; but &quot;what does a good citizen do, and what must he know to do it?&quot; Citizenship education cannot be imparted merely by providing students with factual information. There are four techniques which are used to develop skills and attitudes to deal with problems of group life and which have received attention of educationists: (1) Group Discussion, (2) Sociodrama and Role -playing, (3) Use of Sociograms and other Devices of Sociometry, and (4) Application of Action Research. There is a need to develop a programme in which elements of all the four techniques are used and integrated as far as possible. The Youth Parliament is a programme in which group discussion and role-playing techniques can effectively be used. The purposes of Youth Parliament are as follows: 1. To make students understand the parliamentary procedure. 2. To develop in students an insight into the working of parliament 3. To make students consider public issues and form their opinion on them. 4. To train students in the technique of group discussion 5. To develop in students an ability to arrive at a decision after group discussion. 6. To develop them in them respect and tolerance for the views of others. 7. To develop in them an understanding that respect for rules is essential for conducting any discussion systematically and effectively.8. To train students in group behaviour.9. To make students aware of various problems facing our society and the country. 10. To develop in students the quality of leadership. 11.
